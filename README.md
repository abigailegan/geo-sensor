# GEO Sensor Code
C.O.N.D.O.R.S. 2020-2021

This branch (master) contains the code that is currently found on the Arduino.

* The new_code.ino file currently contains everything for sensing, calibration, writing to the SD card, etc. The majority of it is straight from last year's team.
* The LinearRegression files are used in the calibrate functions. The two files are from [cubiwan's](https://github.com/cubiwan) repo [LinearRegressino](https://github.com/cubiwan/LinearRegressino)
* The connections file is from last year's team and maps the pin names to their pin numbers.

The other pieces of code from last year's team can be found on their corresponding branches.
