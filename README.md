# GEO Sensor Code
C.O.N.D.O.R.S. 2020-2021

This branch (master) contains the code that is currently found on the Arduino.

* The sensor code does not calibrate any of the results returned by the sensors
* For increased readibility the code is now organized into a sensor.ino file and several header files with corresponding .cpp files for each sensor.

The other pieces of code from last year's team can be found on their corresponding branches.
