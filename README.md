# GEO Sensor Code
C.O.N.D.O.R.S. 2020-2021

This branch (master) contains the code that is currently found on the Arduino.

* The sensor code does not calibrate any of the results returned by the sensors
* The code is organized into a sensor.ino file and several header files with corresponding .cpp files for each sensor for increased organization and readability.

The other pieces of code from last year's team can be found on their corresponding branches.
