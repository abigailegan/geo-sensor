# GEO
GEO Sensor Code

The main code is in new_code/new_code.ino, and details on the files can be found below.

## Calibration_Regression (incorporate this)
Some code that could be used in a future iteration of the calibration mode program.

## Test_Code (an easy start)
Basic temperature-reading, LED-blinking code.

## new_code (what you want!)
This year's (2019-2020) code, which supports standard operation (reading CO/CO2/PM sensors) and calibration mode. The included files are also archived in this folder for future reference.

## Final_Code.ino (just FYI)
Reference code from last year's project (2018-2019), NOT to be confused with this year's code.

## input_text.pde (a way to see things)
Code for a possible GUI; uses Processing language.
